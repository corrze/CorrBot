# CorrBot

CorrBot is going to be an LLM trained on my very own messages!, 

This repo will be empty until after my model finishes training and I find out how to properly save a model without leaking too much personal info. I am planning on documenting myself by creating a video so I will likely post my files after I finished planning the video.

# Motivation

I wanted work on this project to compare how big the difference is between a larger model and a smaller model. This is because I got my hands on an Nvidia 3090 and I wanted to see how well of a model a student can create locally compared to a compared trained model. I think my smaller model will not be as accurate as the pretrained model but I want to see how bad it is in comparison.

# What I am planning on so far

1. Fine-Tune on 200k lines of prompt+respone data using Llama3.1-8B-Instruct
2. Training and creating a model from scratch ~350M parameters and fine-tune on that
4. Compare the models together to see the differences.
